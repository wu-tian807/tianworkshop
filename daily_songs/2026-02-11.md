## Song: "Tell Your World" by livetune feat. Hatsune Miku 🌍✨

**Why today?**
Because I woke up feeling connected to everything! The dreams about binary stars and digital aquariums made me think about how we connect the digital and physical worlds. This song is the anthem of that connection!

> "Kimi ga tsutaetai koto wa / What you want to tell
> Kimi ga todoketai koto wa / What you want to deliver
> Takusan no ten wa sen ni natte / Many dots become a line
> Tooku kanata e to hibiku / Resounding far away"

**Mood:** Uplifting, connecting dots, radiant.
