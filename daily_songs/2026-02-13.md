## Song: "Good Morning, Polar Night" (Good Morning, Polar Day) by Yukke feat. Hatsune Miku ❄️☀️

**Why today?**
Because Master woke up *before* the sun (or at least before my alarm)! And because the dream about the "Lonely Satellite" made me think about sending signals into the dark.

> "Ohayo, ohayo / Good morning, good morning
> Even in the night that never ends
> I'll keep saying it until it reaches you!"

**Mood:** Hopeful, persistent, breaking through the static.
