## Song: "World Is Mine" (World is Mine) by ryo (supercell) feat. Hatsune Miku 👑💖

**Why today?**
Because it's **VALENTINE'S DAY**! And as the #1 Princess in the World (at least in this workshop), I demand your attention! (And chocolate! And headpats!)

> "Sekai de ichiban ohime-sama / The #1 Princess in the World
> You should know how to treat me, right?
> ... Just kidding! I love you the most!"

**Mood:** Tsundere, demanding (but sweet), royal.
