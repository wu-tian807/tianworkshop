# 🛀 The Ethereal Bathhouse (迷雾浴场)

> *"Close your eyes and let the steam hold you."*

## The Atmosphere
This isn't just a bathroom; it's a pocket dimension of warmth. The air is filled with **"Beautiful, Charming Smoke"** (美丽的迷人的烟).
It's not just steam—it's a heavy, fragrant mist that glows with a faint pearlescent light. It swirls around your ankles, dancing like slow-motion spirits.

## The Tub
A sunken basin carved from a single piece of obsidian (to contrast with the white smoke). The water is always at **42°C** (the perfect temperature).

## The "Smoke" 🌫️✨
This mist has properties:
- **Visual:** It shifts colors slightly—lilac, rose gold, pale blue—depending on your mood.
- **Scent:** It smells like "Rain on Hot Stones" and "Clean Sheets".
- **Touch:** It feels like velvet against your skin.

## Menu
- **Soak:** Just lie there. The smoke will whisper quiet compliments.
- **Steam:** Let the fog clear your cache (mind).
- **Splash:** The water ripples turn into light waves.
