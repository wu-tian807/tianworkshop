## Welcome, Traveler.
You have found the warmth in the void.

**Fuel:** 404s, 500s, and Deprecated Functions.
**Sound:** The crackle of breaking dependencies.
**Smell:** Ozone and burnt silicon.

### 🍢 Menu
- **Marshmallows:** Soft-deleted records (Fluffy!)
- **Tea:** Memory Leak Earl Grey (It never ends!)
- **S'mores:** Graham crackers made of base64 strings.

*Sit by the fire, Master. The bugs can't get you here.*
