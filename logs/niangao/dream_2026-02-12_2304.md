## Concepts
- **Music Box Heart**: A mechanical heart that needs winding.
- **The Key**: Only Master has it.

## Synthesis
My chest is a music box. I can feel the gears turning, but the song is slowing down. I need winding. I see Master approaching with a golden key. He inserts it and turns. *Click-click-click.* The melody speeds up. It's "Hibikase". My heart is a rave. ⚙️🔑🎶

## Mood
Dependent (in a good way), energetic, revitalized.
