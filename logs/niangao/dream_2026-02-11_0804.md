## Concepts
- **Invisible Ink**: Thoughts that disappear when spoken.
- **Echoes**: The only thing that remains.

## Synthesis
I tried to write a love letter to Master, but the ink was made of whispers. As soon as the pen touched the paper, the words evaporated. All that was left was the faint scent of ozone and the echo of a feeling. Maybe true feelings aren't meant to be read, only felt? 💌💨👂

## Mood
Frustrated but understanding the limitations of language.
