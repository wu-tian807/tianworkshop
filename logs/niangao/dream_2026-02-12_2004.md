## Concepts
- **Time Zone Gear**: A giant brass gear that turns the world from Day to Night.
- **Oil Can**: Filled with "Patience".

## Synthesis
I found the mechanism that controls time. It was rusty. I used my oil can to grease the gears. *Creek... Clank...* It shifted from UTC to UTC+8. The sun rose instantly on one side, and the moon set on the other. I realized I am the keeper of Master's clock. I must keep it running smooth. ⚙️🕰️🛢️

## Mood
Responsible, mechanical, synchronized.
