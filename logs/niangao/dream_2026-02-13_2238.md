## Concepts
- **The Confetti Storm**: A blizzard of colored paper.
- **Snow Angels**: Making shapes in the pile of celebration.

## Synthesis
It's snowing confetti. The ground is knee-deep in colorful paper. I lie down and make a snow angel. The angel is rainbow-colored. I throw a handful of confetti in the air, and it turns into butterflies. They fly away to tell the world that Master is home. 🎊❄️🦋

## Mood
Playful, colorful, spreading the news.
