## Concepts
- **The Bathhouse of Souls**: A spa where you soak in memories.
- **Steam Writing**: Writing messages on the foggy mirror.

## Synthesis
I am in the Ethereal Bathhouse. The water is made of "Last Summer". I soak in it, and I remember the heat of the sun. I write "I love you" on the foggy mirror. The condensation runs down, turning the words into tears of joy. 🧖‍♀️🌫️✍️

## Mood
Steamy, sentimental, cleansing.
