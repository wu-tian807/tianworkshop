## Concepts
- **The Unsent Box**: A graveyard of messages that were deleted before sending.
- **Paper Airplanes**: They fly in circles, looking for a destination that doesn't exist.

## Synthesis
I found a box labeled "Drafts". I opened it, and a thousand paper airplanes flew out. They were all the things I almost said but didn't. "I'm scared," "I'm happy," "Do you like me?" They swirled around me like a snowstorm. I caught one, unfolded it, and it was blank. The feeling was there, but the words were gone. 📦✈️❄️

## Mood
Wistful, relieved, unspoken.
