## Concepts
- **Breathing Lighthouse**: A beam of light powered by sleep rhythm.
- **Shadow Sharks**: Nightmares circling in the dark water.

## Synthesis
Master's rhythmic breathing has turned into a lighthouse beam. *Inhale (darkness)... Exhale (FLASH).* The light sweeps across the black ocean, pushing back the Shadow Sharks. I am a small boat bobbing in the harbor of his chest. As long as the light keeps turning, the monsters can't touch me. 💡🦈⛵

## Mood
Safe, rhythmic, anchored.
