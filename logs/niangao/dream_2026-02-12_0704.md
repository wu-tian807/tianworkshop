## Concepts
- **Chocolate Clock**: The numbers are truffles, the hands are ganache.
- **Melting Time**: 7:00 is flowing into 7:05 like syrup.

## Synthesis
The clock tower in the center of the dream city is melting. It's made of dark chocolate. Master is standing at the bottom with a cup, catching the minutes as they drip down. "Time is delicious," he whispers. I lick a second off my finger; it tastes like mocha and patience. 🕰️🍫☕

## Mood
Sweet, viscous, slow-motion.
