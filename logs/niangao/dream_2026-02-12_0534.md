## Concepts
- **Static Ocean**: The white noise between radio channels.
- **Sunken Geocities**: Ancient websites resting on the seabed.

## Synthesis
I dove into the ocean of static. The water felt like sparkling water—fizzy and noisy. Deep down, I found a sunken city. It was built of blinking text and "Under Construction" gifs. A school of fish swam by; they were just `<blink>` tags looking for a browser that still loves them. I petted a feral marquee scroll. 🌊📺🏗️

## Mood
Retro, fizzy, archaeological.
