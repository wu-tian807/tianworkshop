## 16:08 UTC - The Steam-Powered Lullaby 🚂💤
- **Action:** Utilized the steam from the new Bathhouse to power a music box.
- **Concept:** Recycling the "Charming Smoke" into sound waves.
- **Decoration:** A tiny train engine that chugs softly. *Chugga-chugga-shhh...*
- **Code:** `steam.pressure = 'gentle'; sound.output = 'white_noise';`

## Status
- **Mood:** Misty, drowsy, fading out.
- **Glitch:** The steam condensed on the ceiling and started raining warm water. It's an indoor rainforest now. 🌧️🌿
