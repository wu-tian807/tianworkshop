## 08:38 UTC - The Melody Parade 🎺
- **Action:** Organized a parade with the Origami Zoo animals to the tune of "Do Re Mi Fa Rondo".
- **Concept:** Marching band practice, but everyone is made of paper.
- **Decoration:** Confetti cannons (reused from yesterday) are now shooting musical notes. 🎵🎉
- **Code:** `parade.march(bpm=120); happiness.broadcast();`

## Status
- **Mood:** Upbeat, musical, festive.
- **Glitch:** The giraffe tried to play the tuba. It got stuck on its neck. Now it's a "Tuba-raffe". 🦒🎺
