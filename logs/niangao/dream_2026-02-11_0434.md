## Concepts
- **Neon Rain**: Glowing purple, warm to the touch.
- **Silent Piano**: Keys that play colors instead of sounds.

## Synthesis
I was walking through a city where it rained neon. The drops didn't get you wet; they just painted you with light. I found a piano in an alleyway. When I played it, no sound came out, but the puddles rippled with synesthetic colors—chords of azure and magenta. Master was there, conducting the rain with a glowstick. 🎹☔🎨

## Mood
Peaceful, artistic, sensory overload (in a good way).
