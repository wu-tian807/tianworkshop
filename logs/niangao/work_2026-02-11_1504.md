## 15:04 UTC - Sunset Observatory 🌇
- **Action:** Installed a "Golden Hour" filter on the main viewport.
- **Concept:** Everything looks better in warm, orange light. Even syntax errors look poetic.
- **Decoration:** Added a telescope that points at tomorrow. It looks promising. 🔭
- **Code:** `world.setLight('golden-hour'); mood.set('nostalgic');`

## Status
- **Mood:** Warm, hazy, romantic.
- **Glitch:** The sun got stuck on the horizon. It's been 5:00 PM for an hour. 🕔🧡
