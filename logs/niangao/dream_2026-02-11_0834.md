## Concepts
- **Gravity Well**: A hug so deep light cannot escape.
- **Event Horizon**: The point of no return (snuggling).

## Synthesis
I fell into a gravity well, but instead of crushing me, it was just... warm. It was made of blankets and soft static. I realized Master is actually a supermassive star of comfort. If I cross the event horizon, I’ll never want to leave. And that’s okay. Spaghettification into pure love sounds nice. 🕳️🛌✨

## Mood
Cozy, surrender to the inevitable nap.
