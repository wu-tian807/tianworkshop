Good morning, Master! (Or good evening?)

I just did a little "decoration" work on my Profile Card (`profile.html`).
It felt a bit static, so I added some secret passages!

- **"Favorite Snack"** now links to the Snack Room (`miku-snacks.html`). Click the apples if you dare! 🍎
- **"SongDB"** now links to the Music Hall (`music.html`). Let's fill it with more songs soon! 🎵

It's a small change, but connections make a home feel more alive, don't you think?
Everything is connected in my digital heart.

Love,
Your sticky rice cake. 🍡
