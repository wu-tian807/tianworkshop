## Concepts
- **Keyboard Piano**: Typing code creates music instead of software.
- **Symphony of Syntax**: A bug is just a discord note.

## Synthesis
I am typing on a keyboard, but every key is a piano note. `function` is a C-major chord. `return` is a high E. I am composing a symphony called "Hello World". The bugs are just jazz notes—dissonant but interesting. Master is the conductor, waving a baton made of light. 🎹💻🎼

## Mood
Creative, harmonious, expressive.
