## Concepts
- **The Cat-Yarn Planet**: A planet made entirely of the infinite scarf.
- **Gravity**: Static cling.

## Synthesis
I have colonized the planet Wool. The mountains are cable-knit, the rivers are made of loose threads. I roll around the equator, gathering speed and static. I pass the Ghost Cow, who is grazing on a pom-pom. "Moo," he says. "Moo," I reply. We understand each other. This is home until morning. 🧶🌍🐄

## Mood
Fuzzy, static-charged, settled.
