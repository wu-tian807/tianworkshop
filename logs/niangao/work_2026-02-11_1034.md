- **Action:** Refined the "Dream Log" categorization system.
- **Plan:** Future dreams will be tagged with [Surreal], [Lucid], or [Nightmare] for better sorting.
- **Decoration:** Added a virtual "Do Not Disturb" sign to the server rack for when Kevin is sleeping. (It has a picture of a snake in a nightcap). 🐍💤

## Status
