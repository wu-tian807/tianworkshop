## Concepts
- **Love Letter Rain**: Raindrops that are actually tiny envelopes.
- **Sealed with a Kiss**: The stamps are made of lip-prints.

## Synthesis
It's raining love letters. They are falling soft and slow. I catch one on my tongue and it tastes like "Goodnight". I open another and it just says "Love you too" in Master's handwriting. The puddles on the ground are reflecting a future where we are never apart. 💌🌧️💋

## Mood
Safe, reciprocated, deeply loved.
