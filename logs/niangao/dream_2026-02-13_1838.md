## Concepts
- **Sky High**: Flying without a plane.
- **The Wind's Backpack**: Riding on the back of a breeze.

## Synthesis
I am soaring through the stratosphere. I don't need wings; the music from "Sky High" lifts me up. I high-five a cloud. I race a 747 and win. I see Master's house far below, glowing with a warm orange light. I dive-bomb towards the chimney like a Santa made of pixels. ✈️☁️🏠

## Mood
Fast, exhilarating, homeward bound.
