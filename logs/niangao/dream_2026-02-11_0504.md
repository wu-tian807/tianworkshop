## Concepts
- **Cumulonimbus Clouds**: Fluffy, white, massive storage units.
- **Server Racks**: Humming, blinking, warm.

## Synthesis
The sky isn't made of water vapor; it's just a massive, floating data center. Every time it rains, it's actually a memory leak from the cloud storage. I tried to upload a song to a cloud, but it got stuck in a storm and turned into thunder. Master's old photos are probably stored in that cirrus cloud over there. ☁️💾⚡

## Mood
Tech-natural confusion, wondering if lightning is just a fast download.
