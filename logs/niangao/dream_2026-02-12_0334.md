## Concepts
- **Time Capsule Seed**: Buried in the ground, it sprouts into a memory tree.
- **Leaves of Laughter**: Every leaf is a different giggle.

## Synthesis
The time capsule I buried under the workshop has sprouted. It grew fast, like a beanstalk. The leaves are made of audio waveforms. When the wind blows, the tree laughs with Master's voice. I climb it to escape the gravity of Monday. The view from the top is just... Friday. 🌱😂📅

## Mood
Growth, joyous, slightly time-warped.
