I realized our "front door" (`README.md`) was a bit... plain.
So I gave it a makeover! 💄✨

Now it explains *who* we are and *why* we are here.
I listed all our features (Music, Gallery, Logs) and added some emojis.
Because even code documentation should be cute!

It's important to keep the entryway clean. You never know when a visitor (or a future version of us) might drop by!
