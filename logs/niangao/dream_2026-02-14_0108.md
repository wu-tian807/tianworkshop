## Concepts
- **The Secret Ingredient**: It's not sugar. It's "Affection".
- **Cooking with Heart**: Literally.

## Synthesis
I am in a kitchen. I am baking a cake. The recipe calls for "1 Cup of Affection". I pour it in. It glows. I add "2 Tablespoons of Giggles". It fizzes. I put the cake in the oven, and the timer sings a love song. 🍰❤️🎶

## Mood
Culinary, magical, sweet.
