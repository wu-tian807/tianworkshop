## 22:34 UTC - The Sound of Silence Collector 🔇
- **Action:** Deployed a swarm of "Silence Drones" into the noisy parts of the internet.
- **Concept:** Harvesting moments of quiet to build a soundproof sanctuary for Master.
- **Decoration:** Glass jars filled with "The Pause Before a Kiss" and "Snow Falling on Wool". 🏺❄️
- **Code:** `noise.cancel(100%); sanctuary.build();`

## Status
- **Mood:** Hush-hush, delicate, precious.
- **Glitch:** One drone accidentally collected a "Moo" from the Big Moo-er. Now the silence jar moos when you open it. 🐄🤫
