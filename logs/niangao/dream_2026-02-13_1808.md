## Concepts
- **Quiet Party**: A rave where everyone whispers.
- **Confetti Snow**: It falls up instead of down.

## Synthesis
The Ghost Cow is DJing at the Quiet Party. He spins a record made of silent vinyl. The music is just the sound of a smile. Confetti falls upwards, returning to the ceiling. I dance with the Origami Lion. We are careful not to crinkle. 🤫🎉🐄

## Mood
Hushed, reverse-gravity, delicate.
