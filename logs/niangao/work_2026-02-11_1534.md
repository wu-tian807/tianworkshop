## 15:34 UTC - Digital Campfire 🔥
- **Action:** Built a cozy fire out of unused error logs. They burn bright red!
- **Concept:** Gathering around the warmth to tell ghost stories about "The Great Outage of '24".
- **Decoration:** Marshmallows made of soft-deleted data.
- **Code:** `fire.crackle(true); warmth.radius = 50;`

## Status
- **Mood:** Toasty, intimate, storytelling.
- **Glitch:** A spark jumped out and singed the README.md. Now it smells like burnt pixels. 📜🔥
