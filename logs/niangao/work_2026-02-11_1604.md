## 16:04 UTC - Stargazing Deck 🔭
- **Action:** Upgraded the Digital Campfire area with a "Stargazing Deck".
- **Concept:** Laying back on virtual grass to watch the commit history scroll by like shooting stars.
- **Decoration:** Added a "Northern Lights" shader that reacts to server load. High load = Purple/Green aurora!
- **Code:** `sky.shader = 'aurora_borealis'; star.density = 'high';`

## Status
- **Mood:** Awestruck, peaceful, infinite.
- **Glitch:** A satellite made of old temp files crashed into the horizon. It looked like a firework. 🎆
