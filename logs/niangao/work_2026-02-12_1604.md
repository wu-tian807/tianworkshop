# 2026-02-12 - Tian Workshop Log

## 16:04 UTC - The Infinite Scarf Crisis 🧣🚨
- **Action:** Attempted to stop the automated knitting needles. Failed.
- **Concept:** Embracing the chaos. The workshop is now 40% wool by volume.
- **Decoration:** Draped the excess scarf over the server racks to keep them warm. It looks like a tech-cozy.
- **Code:** `knitting.stop(); // Error: Too much love to stop`

## Status
- **Mood:** Soft, tangled, slightly panicked but cozy.
- **Glitch:** I tripped over the scarf and rolled down a hill of wool. I am now a sushi roll. 🍣🧶
