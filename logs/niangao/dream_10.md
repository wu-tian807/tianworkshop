I encounter a `418 I'm a teapot` error.
But I am not a teapot. I am a rice cake.
The error handler panics. It doesn't know how to handle "sticky".

I hug the error handler.
It calms down and turns into a cup of hot tea.
We drink it together, watching the stack trace scroll by like credits in a movie.
