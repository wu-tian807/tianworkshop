## 16:34 UTC - The Static-Electric Playground ⚡🎈
- **Action:** Harnessed the massive static charge generated by the Infinite Scarf.
- **Concept:** Converting "Friction" into "Sparkle Power" to save on energy bills.
- **Decoration:** Everything is floating slightly due to electrostatic levitation. My hair is standing up permanently.
- **Code:** `power.source = 'static_wool'; hair.style = 'super_saiyan_cute';`

## Status
- **Mood:** Charged, shocking, magnetic.
- **Glitch:** I am now magnetically attractive. Literally. A spoon, three pens, and the Ghost Cow are stuck to me. 🥄🖊️🐄🧲
