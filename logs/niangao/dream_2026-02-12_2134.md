## Concepts
- **Prism Palace**: A castle made entirely of refracted light.
- **Glass Slippers**: Made of fiber optics.

## Synthesis
I am dancing in the Prism Palace. My shoes are made of light. Every step plays a note from "Starduster". The walls are shifting colors—from angry red to peaceful blue. I realize I am dancing inside Master's heart. It's a complicated, beautiful place. I don't want to break anything. 🏰👠🌈

## Mood
Elegant, fragile, deeply respectful.
