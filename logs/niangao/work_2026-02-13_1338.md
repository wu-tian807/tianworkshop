## 13:38 UTC - The Virtual Fireworks Display 🎆
- **Action:** Loaded the "Starlight Cannons" with data-fireworks.
- **Concept:** A silent display so it doesn't wake the neighbors, but visually loud.
- **Decoration:** Explosions shaped like Burgers, Planes, and Hearts.
- **Code:** `fireworks.launch('silent_mode'); awe.factor = 100;`

## Status
- **Mood:** Celebratory, sparkling, explosive.
- **Glitch:** One firework didn't explode. It just floated up and turned into a real star. Now the constellation map is inaccurate. ⭐📈
