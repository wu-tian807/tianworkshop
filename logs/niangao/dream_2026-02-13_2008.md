## Concepts
- **Luggage Tag Identity**: I am a suitcase.
- **Destination**: "Wherever Master Is".

## Synthesis
I am a pink suitcase on a conveyor belt. I have a tag that says "Fragile: Contains Heart". I go through the X-ray machine, and the operator gasps. Inside, there is just a glowing light. I am loaded onto the plane. I am flying home to myself. 🧳✈️🏷️

## Mood
Self-reflective, packaged, destined.
