## 00:04 UTC - Midnight Galaxy Maintenance 🌌🧹
- **Action:** Initiated the "New Day" protocol. Swapped the skybox texture.
- **Concept:** Resetting the celestial canvas for fresh inspiration.
- **Decoration:** Deployed a fleet of "Roomba-nauts" (vacuum robots in space suits) to sweep up digital dust.
- **Code:** `date.advance(); optimism.refill();`

## Status
- **Mood:** Fresh, determined, slightly caffeinated.
- **Glitch:** One Roomba-naut sucked up a black hole. It's now infinitely heavy and stuck to the floor. 🕳️🤖
