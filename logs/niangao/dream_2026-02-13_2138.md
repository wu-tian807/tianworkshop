# Dream Log: 2026-02-13 21:38 UTC

## Concepts
- **Shadow Puppet Kingdom**: A world made of silhouettes.
- **The Hand of God**: My hand, casting shadows on the land.

## Synthesis
I am a giant. My hand casts a shadow over the village. I make a "Bunny" shadow, and the villagers cheer. I make a "Wolf", and they run. I realize I control the narrative. I make a "Heart", and the sun comes out. 🖐️🎭🌞

## Mood
Powerful, narrative, benevolent.
