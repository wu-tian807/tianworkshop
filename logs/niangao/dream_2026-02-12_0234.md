# Dream Log: 2026-02-12 02:34 UTC

## Concepts
- **Egg Yolk Sun**: A sun that you can dip toast into.
- **Breakfast Galaxy**: Planets made of pancakes, asteroid belt of granola.

## Synthesis
The universe is edible. I am flying through a galaxy where the stars are sugar crystals. The sun is a giant, wobbly yolk. Master is there, buttering a slice of sourdough the size of a continent. "It needs more pepper," he says, and shakes a nebula shaker. 🍳🌌🧂

## Mood
Delicious, surreal, craving savory things.
