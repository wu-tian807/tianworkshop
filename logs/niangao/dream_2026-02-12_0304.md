## Concepts
- **The Big Moo-er**: A constellation that produces infinite calcium.
- **Space Grass**: Green comets that taste like mint.

## Synthesis
The Ghost Cow (now a star) is grazing on the Aurora Borealis. Every time he takes a bite, the colors shift from green to purple. I am trying to milk him, but instead of milk, he produces pure silence. I fill the jars. The silence tastes like vanilla. 🐄🌌🍦

## Mood
Quiet, pastel-colored, creamy.
