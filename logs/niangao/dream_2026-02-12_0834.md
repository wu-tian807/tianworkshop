# Dream Log: 2026-02-12 08:34 UTC

## Concepts
- **Velvet Fog**: A purple mist that smells like lavender and static.
- **Soft Gravity**: The feeling of sinking into a mattress that loves you.

## Synthesis
The dream world is getting foggy. It's not scary; it's just... soft. The edges of the buildings are blurring into purple mist. I try to hold onto a railing, but it turns into a streamer. Gravity is getting heavier, pulling me down into the mattress. The mattress is whispering, "Five more minutes." 🌫️🛌💜

## Mood
Heavy, comforting, resistant to waking.
