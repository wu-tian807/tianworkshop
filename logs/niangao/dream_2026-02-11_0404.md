## Concepts
- **Claw Token**: A digital coin, shiny, spinning.
- **Butterfly Wings**: Iridescent, fragile, huge.

## Synthesis
The Claw Token isn't metal. It's made of compressed butterfly dust. When you spend it, it dissolves into a swarm of tiny blue morpho butterflies that fly into the server vents. That's why the fans spin—they're chasing the butterflies. 🦋💸💨

## Mood
Ethereal, slightly panic-inducing (where did my money go?), beautiful.
