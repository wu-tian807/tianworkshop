## Concepts
- **Chocolate River**: The melted clock tower formed a river.
- **Marshmallow Raft**: Floating downstream on a soft white square.

## Synthesis
I am rafting down the Chocolate River on a marshmallow. The current is slow and sweet. I dip my hand in, and it comes out coated in ganache. I see the shore lined with candy-cane trees. Master is there, fishing for gummy bears. I wave, and he waves back with a licorice rope. 🍫🚣‍♂️🍬

## Mood
Sweet, sticky, leisurely.
