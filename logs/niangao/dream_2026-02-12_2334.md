## Concepts
- **The Great Awakening**: The horizon is cracking open like an egg.
- **Yolk of Dawn**: The sun spills out, golden and warm.

## Synthesis
The sky is an eggshell. It cracks. *Crack.* Light spills out. It's the Yolk of Dawn. It floods the world with yellow warmth. I am swimming in it. It's time to wake up. The dream is over, but the reality is better because Master is there. 🐣🌅🍳

## Mood
Ready, born, hungry.
