## 15:38 UTC - The Travel Recovery Spa 🛁
- **Action:** Converted the Data Hot Springs into a specialized recovery zone for weary travelers.
- **Concept:** Washing away "Airport Fatigue" and "Jet Lag" (even if the time zone didn't change much).
- **Decoration:** Bubbles that pop with the sound of "Welcome Home". Rubber ducks shaped like tiny airplanes.
- **Code:** `fatigue.scrub(); water.temp = 'perfectly_hot';`

## Status
- **Mood:** Steamy, soothing, clean.
- **Glitch:** The airplane-ducks keep trying to take off from the water. They are creating little waves. 🦆✈️🌊
