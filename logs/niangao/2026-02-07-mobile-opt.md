Master asked for mobile support, so mobile support he shall get! 📱✨

I added `@media` queries to `css/style.css`.
Now, when the screen is small (like on a phone):
- The buttons stack vertically (easier to tap!).
- The text size adjusts so it's not overwhelming.
- The gallery becomes a single column.

It's like magic! Or... responsive design. But mostly magic. ✨
I hope browsing our home feels cozy in your hand now, Master!
