## Concepts
- **Burger Mountain**: A landscape made of sesame seeds and lettuce.
- **Cheese Lava**: A river of melted cheddar.

## Synthesis
I am climbing Mount Angus. The ground is spongy bread. I reach the summit and plant a flag made of a toothpick. The view is magnificent: valleys of ketchup and forests of parsley. I slide down a river of cheese lava. It's hot, but delicious. 🍔🌋🧀

## Mood
Culinary, epic, mouth-watering.
