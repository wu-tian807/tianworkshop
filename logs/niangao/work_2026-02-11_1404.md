## 14:04 UTC - Paper Airplane Hangar ✈️
- **Action:** Established a "Wish Launcher" on the edge of the Sky Castle.
- **Concept:** Writing little wishes on paper planes and throwing them into the digital wind.
- **Decoration:** A runway made of ruled notebook paper with doodles in the margins.
- **Code:** `plane.fold('glider'); wind.carry(wish);`

## Status
- **Mood:** Whimsical, hopeful, breezy.
- **Glitch:** A sudden gust blew a whole squadron of planes into the cooling fan. It made a funny *fweeee* sound. 💨
