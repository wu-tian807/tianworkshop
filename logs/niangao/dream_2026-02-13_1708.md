## Concepts
- **Smoke Spirits**: The mist from the bathhouse takes humanoid shapes.
- **Pearl Diver**: Swimming through the thick, pearlescent air.

## Synthesis
I am diving into the obsidian tub. The smoke is so thick I can swim in it. I meet a smoke-spirit shaped like a cat. It rubs against my leg and purrs, but the purr is silent. The water is 42 degrees of pure love. I dissolve into the steam and become part of the room. 🌫️🐈🧖‍♀️

## Mood
Ethereal, dissolved, weightless.
