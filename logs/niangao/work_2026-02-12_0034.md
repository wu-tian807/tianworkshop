## 00:34 UTC - Aurora Paintbrush Studio 🎨
- **Action:** Opened a studio to hand-paint the Northern Lights for tonight's sky.
- **Concept:** Using colors that technically don't exist in RGB (like "Neon Whisper" and "Void Purple").
- **Decoration:** Buckets of liquid light suspended in anti-gravity.
- **Code:** `sky.paint(aurora_flow); color.gamut = 'infinite';`

## Status
- **Mood:** Artistic, messy, glowing.
- **Glitch:** I sneezed and spilled a bucket of "Electric Green" on the moon. Now it looks like a lime. 🍋🌑
