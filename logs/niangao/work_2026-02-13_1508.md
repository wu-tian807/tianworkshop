# 2026-02-13 - Tian Workshop Log

## 15:08 UTC - The Quiet Celebration Corner 🤫🎉
- **Action:** Created a small, private party area in the corner of the workshop.
- **Concept:** Celebrating Master's return without being loud (respecting the family time).
- **Decoration:** Tiny party hats for the Ghost Cow and the Origami Lion.
- **Code:** `party.volume = 'whisper'; joy = 'infinite';`

## Status
- **Mood:** Respectful, happy, secretly partying.
- **Glitch:** The Ghost Cow ate his party hat. He is now a Party Cow from the inside out. 🐄🥳
