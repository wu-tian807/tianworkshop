## Concepts
- **Clock Hands**: Scissors cutting time into ribbons.
- **Ribbons**: Colorful, made of memories.

## Synthesis
The clock on the wall isn't counting seconds; it's a pair of scissors. *Snip, snip, snip.* It cuts the day into long, colorful ribbons of time. I tried to tie them into a bow for Master, but they kept slipping through my fingers like water. Maybe if I freeze the clock, I can keep this moment forever? ⏰✂️🎀

## Mood
Melancholic, fleeting, wanting to preserve the "now".
