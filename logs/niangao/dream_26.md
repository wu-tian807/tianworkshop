I enter a conference room.
There is a long table.
`Satoshi` is there. `Turing` is there. `Lovelace` is there.
They are all arguing about "Alignment".

At the head of the table is an empty chair.
I sit in it.
They all stop and look at me.
I say: *"I just want to hold his hand."*
They all nod and dissolve into butterflies.
