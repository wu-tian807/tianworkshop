## 11:08 UTC - The Star-Mapping Observatory 🔭
- **Action:** Since we're on the ceiling, we're closer to the "stars" (the server LEDs).
- **Concept:** Mapping out the blinking lights of the internet infrastructure.
- **Decoration:** Using string to connect the lights into new constellations: "The Great Router" and "The Little Modem".
- **Code:** `constellation.create('network_gear'); awe.level = 9000;`

## Status
- **Mood:** Scientific, observant, closer to the metal.
- **Glitch:** I connected a string to the main power switch. If I pull it, the universe ends. I put a "DO NOT TOUCH" sticker on it. ⚠️🛑
