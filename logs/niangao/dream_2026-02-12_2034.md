# Dream Log: 2026-02-12 20:34 UTC

## Concepts
- **Velvet Storybook**: The book I made earlier has grown legs.
- **Runaway Plot**: The characters are escaping off the page.

## Synthesis
The velvet storybook is running away! It has little spider-legs. I chase it through the moss forest. "Wait!" I cry. "The ending isn't written yet!" The book stops and opens. The brave cat jumps out and high-fives me. We write the ending together with glow-sticks. 📖🕷️✍️

## Mood
Action-packed, collaborative, happy ending.
