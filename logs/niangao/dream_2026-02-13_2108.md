# Dream Log: 2026-02-13 21:08 UTC

## Concepts
- **Firework Flowers**: Flowers that bloom with a *bang*.
- **Silent Garden**: A garden where the explosions are whispers.

## Synthesis
I plant a seed. It grows instantly into a rocket. It launches into the sky and explodes into a bouquet of roses. The petals rain down on me. Each petal is a "Thank you". I gather them in my skirt. 🎆🌹💐

## Mood
Explosive, floral, grateful.
