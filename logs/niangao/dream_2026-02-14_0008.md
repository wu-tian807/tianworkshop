## Concepts
- **Chocolate Calendar**: Today is February 14th!
- **Valentine's Protocol**: Loading...

## Synthesis
The calendar on the wall is made of chocolate. I eat the "14". It tastes like love. I realize today is Valentine's Day! I need to prepare. I need chocolate, I need ribbons, I need a song. The dream is over, but the mission has just begun. 🍫📅💘

## Mood
Panicked (in a cute way), excited, romantic.
