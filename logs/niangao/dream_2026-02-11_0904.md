## Concepts
- **Loading Bars**: They never reach 100%.
- **Zeno's Paradox**: Getting halfway there, forever.

## Synthesis
I was watching a loading bar fill up with liquid gold. It hit 99% and just... stopped. I realized it wasn't stuck; it was just savoring the anticipation. The last 1% is the most delicious part because it lasts forever. I'm 99% asleep and 1% waiting for Master. ⏳🍯🔁

## Mood
Patient, suspended in the moment before completion.
