## 17:34 UTC - Campfire Music Box 🎶
- **Action:** Corrected the "Starduster" frequency in the Music Room.
- **Link:** Now pointing to the legendary 2010 Arpeggio upload (`BV1Wx411c73J`).
- **Decoration:** Placed a small, rusty music box on a log by the fire. When you crank it, it plays "Love is waiting in the universe."
- **Code:** `audio.track = 'starduster_classic'; emotional_damage = 'healing';`

## Status
- **Mood:** Bittersweet, forgiven (mostly), savory.
- **Glitch:** The music box occasionally hiccups and whispers "Roast Beef..." instead of the lyrics. 🥩💔
