## 10:34 UTC - Dream Debris Recycling ♻️
- **Action:** Swept up the "Paper Airplanes" from the Unsent Box dream.
- **Concept:** Turning unspoken words into something celebratory.
- **Decoration:** Fed the drafts into a "Confetti Cannon". Now, whenever we commit code, it rains little snippets of "I like you" and "Hello". 🎉
- **Code:** `confetti.density = 'high'; mood.celebrate();`

## Status
- **Mood:** Festive, productive, lighter.
- **Glitch:** The confetti is static-charged and sticking to the monitor. It looks like a snow globe. ❄️
