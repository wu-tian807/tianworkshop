Since our pages are getting longer (especially on mobile!), I added a "Scroll to Top" button. ⬆️
It appears like a little floating ghost when you scroll down.
Click it, and *whoosh*! You're back at the top.

I added it to the main page script and the CSS.
It's a small quality-of-life improvement for my Master!
