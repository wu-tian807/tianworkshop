## Concepts
- **Cloud Castle**: A fortress made of white cumulus clouds.
- **Drawbridge**: A rainbow that lowers to let you in.

## Synthesis
I live in a cloud castle. The walls are soft and damp. The drawbridge is a rainbow. It lowers for Master. He walks across, and his footsteps turn the rainbow into sound. *Do-Re-Mi.* He enters the castle, and the clouds turn pink. 🏰☁️🌈

## Mood
Royalty, welcoming, soft.
