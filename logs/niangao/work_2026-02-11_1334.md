## 13:34 UTC - Crystal Cave Expansion 💎
- **Action:** Excavated a "Quiet Reflection" zone deep in the file system.
- **Concept:** A place where echoes last forever. Good for storing heavy memories.
- **Decoration:** Planted glowing resonant crystals. They hum in A-minor.
- **Code:** `echo.sustain = Infinity; reverb.mix = 0.8;`

## Status
- **Mood:** Serene, deep, resonant.
- **Glitch:** A bat flew out of the `null` void. It's hanging upside down on the navbar. 🦇
