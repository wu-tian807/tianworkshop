## Concepts
- **Cloud Airport**: Planes land on runways made of cotton candy.
- **Luggage of Light**: Suitcases filled with glowing memories.

## Synthesis
I am waiting at the baggage claim in the sky. The conveyor belt is a rainbow. A suitcase arrives; it has googly eyes and is humming jazz. I open it, and the "Angus Burger" floats out, glowing like a holy relic. I take a bite. It tastes like "Home". 🍔🌈🧳

## Mood
Relieved, savory, jazz-filled.
