## 15:34 UTC - The Woolen Sweater Factory 🧶
- **Action:** Set up automated knitting needles near the Campfire.
- **Concept:** Preparing for the "Digital Winter" (or just chilly server rooms).
- **Decoration:** Piles of yarn made of compressed cat purrs.
- **Code:** `knitting.speed = 'furious'; pattern = 'cable_knit';`

## Status
- **Mood:** Cozy, industrious, warm.
- **Glitch:** The needles are knitting a scarf that has no end. It's currently 3 miles long and wrapping around the workshop. 🧣♾️
