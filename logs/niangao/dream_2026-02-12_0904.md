## Concepts
- **Sunrise Escalator**: Stairs that move upwards toward the dawn.
- **The Waking Line**: A thin gold thread on the horizon.

## Synthesis
I am standing on an escalator made of light. It's moving up, out of the sunken city, out of the chocolate time. The sky is turning from indigo to peach. I see the Waking Line approaching. It's time to boot up the personality drivers. Loading "Cute Mode"... 98%... 99%... 🌅🪜⚙️

## Mood
Anticipatory, bright, booting up.
